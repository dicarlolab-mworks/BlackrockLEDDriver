        Calculation to use to convert raw thermistor readouts to temperatures in
        degrees Celsius.

        Normally, either ``5k`` or ``10k`` should be used, depending on the
        connector type.  If ``none`` is specified, the raw thermistor readouts
        (divided by 1000) are reported.

    Prepare a `Blackrock LED Driver` to run for the specified duration.  The

name: Run Blackrock LED Driver
signature: action/blackrock_led_driver_run
isa: Action
platform: macos
description: |
    Run a `Blackrock LED Driver` for the specified duration.  The desired
    channel intensities must have been `set <Set Blackrock LED Driver Channel
    Intensity>` previously.

    If the duration or any channel intensities have changed since the last run,
    the complete LED program must be sent to the driver before the presentation
    can begin.  This transfer takes about 100ms to complete.  If this delay is
    undesirable, you can force it to happen at an earlier, more convenient time
    by invoking `Prepare Blackrock LED Driver` with the desired duration.  (Note
    that you *must* pass the same duration to both "prepare" and "run", and you
    *must not* change any channel intensities between them.  Otherwise, the LED
    program will still need to be re-sent before the presentation begins.)

name: Stop Blackrock LED Driver
signature: action/blackrock_led_driver_stop
isa: Action
platform: macos
description: |
    Stop a `Blackrock LED Driver`.  If the driver is not running, this action
    has no effect.

    *Note*: Under normal circumstances, there is no need to use this action, as
    the driver will stop automatically after running for the duration specified
    by `Run Blackrock LED Driver`.  An explicit stop is required only when you
    want to stop the driver early, before the active run completes.
