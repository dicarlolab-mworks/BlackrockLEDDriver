Responses sent from the driver to you:

Literal values are hexadecimal (e.g. "80" is 128 decimal)

Checksum is the sum of all previous command bytes as an unsigned, 8-bit (i.e. overflowed) number

Thermistor values (16-bit unsigned) are the temperature value in Celsius millidegrees ie. a value of 31,415 = 31.415C
