Commands you send to the driver:

05 05 04 1H1 1L1 1H2 1L2 . 1H64 1L64 2H1 2L1 2H2 2L2 ... 50H64 50L64 Checksum //Load a file (64 channels x 50 samples)
05 05 06 PeriodH PeriodL Checksum //Set file time period in 2ms increments
05 05 07 Checksum //Start file
05 05 08 Checksum //Is file playing?
05 05 09 Checksum //Stop file
05 05 80 Checksum //Read thermistor values

Responses sent from the driver to you:

05 05 04 01 Checksum  //Return file loaded (response to 04 message)
05 05 06 PeriodH PeriodL Checksum //Set file time period in 2ms increments (response to 06 message)
05 05 07 01 Checksum //Return File Play Started (response to 07 message)
05 05 08 FilePlaying Checksum //Return FilePlaying (response to 08 message with FilePlaying = 01 if a file is playing or 00 if it is not)
05 05 09 00 Checksum //Return File Play Stopped (response to 09 message)
05 05 80 RefAH RefAL RefBH RefBL RefCH RefCL RefDH RefDL Checksum (response to 80 message)

Literal values are hexadecimal (e.g. "80" is 128 decimal)

Checksum is the sum of all previous command bytes as an unsigned, 8-bit (i.e. overflowed) number

Thermistor values (16-bit unsigned) are the raw thermistor readouts, which can be converted to temperature in degrees Celsius as follows:

    val = float(val)
    val = pullup / ((0xFFFF / val) - 1)
    val = -4.4617 * val + 66

The value of "pullup" depends on the type of connector being used:

    "old" connector: 10
    "new" connector: 5

The "old" connector has a voltage divider with a 10k pull up, while the "new" connector has a 5k pull up (two 10k in parallel).
