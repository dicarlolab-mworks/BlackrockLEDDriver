name: Run Blackrock LED Driver
signature: action/blackrock_led_driver_run
isa: Action
description: |
    Run a `Blackrock LED Driver` for the specified duration.  The
    desired channel intensities must have been set previously.

    If the duration or any channel intensities have changed since the last run,
    the complete LED program must be sent to the driver before the presentation
    can begin.  This transfer takes about 100ms to complete.  If this delay is
    undesirable, you can force it to happen at an earlier, more convenient time
    by invoking `Prepare Blackrock LED Driver` with the desired duration.  (Note
    that you *must* pass the same duration to both "prepare" and "run", and you
    *must not* change any channel intensities between them.  Otherwise, the LED
    program will still need to be re-sent before the presentation begins.)
